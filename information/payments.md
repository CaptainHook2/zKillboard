- You can make payments to <a href="/character/93382481/">zKillboard</a> that will remove ads when you are logged in.
- Even if you run AdBlock (I am ok with that) it is a nice gesture.
- You can be ad free on zKillboard.com
- Each month of ad free time costs <strong>{cost}</strong> ISK.
- Every 6 months you purchase in one lump sum will give you a bonus month!
- There is no limit to how much you can send either. Yes, I got asked that.

To make a payment:

- Send ISK to the character <a href="/character/93382481/">zKillboard</a> (not the corp) in increments of <string>{cost}</stong> ISK, e.g., 5000000 (5m), 30000000 (30m), 60000000 (60m).
- Your payment will be detected within 30-60 minutes (api willing) and applied to the account of the character that sent the ISK.
- The golden wreck icon <img src="/img/golden-wreck.png" rel="tooptip" tooltip="This icon will show under your character"> icon will show under your character on your overview page.
- Thank you!
