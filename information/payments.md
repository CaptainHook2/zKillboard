- You can make payments to <a href="#" onClick="CCPEVE.showInfo(1377, 93382481);">zKillboard</a> that will remove ads when you're logged in.
- You can be ad free on zKillboard.com and all subdomains when they are implemented (SoonTM)
- Each month of ad free time costs <strong>{cost}</strong> ISK.
- Each 6 months you purchase will give you a bonus month
- To make a payment, send ISK to the character <a href="https://zkillboard.com/character/93382481/">zKillboard</a>, or use this handy in game link: <a href="#" onClick="CCPEVE.showInfo(1377, 93382481);">zKillboard</a>.
- The wallet is checked aproximately every 35 minutes.

There are two methods of paying.

- Include your account name in the reason code. E.g. if your login is <strong>squizz</strong>, then include <strong>squizz</strong> in the payment reason. Must be an exact match!
- Have an <a href="/account/api/"">API tied to your account</a> that includes the character you sent the ISK from.

# Subdomain

<p class="alert alert-danger">Subdomains are temporarily out of order because the company that gave me a free wildcard SSL cert now wants to charge me $800, and other companies want to charge me $200+ and/or get a business tax ID out of me. Since I do this for a hobby and am not really interested in spending hundreds of dollars subdomains will not exist until I can find a reasonable replacement. --Squizz</p>
